C - More Malloc and Free

This Repo consists of functions made by using malloc(), calloc(),
realloc() and free() in its implementation to perform several important tasks.
Except explicitly stated, all functions will not make use of any other stdlib
function

The Function Will:
0: Allocate dynamically any memory size lower than INT_MAX
1: Concatenate n byte of a string to another
2: Allocate memory using malloc() as if it was calloc()
3: Create an array of ints from min to max
