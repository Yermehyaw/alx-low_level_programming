C - More Pointers, Arrays and Pointers
More functions using pointers, arrays and pointers.

Description: All functions/programs will not use any standard library fuctions
except explicitly indicated. The function will:
0: Concatenate two strings into the first string
1: Concatenate n bytes of second string into the first
2: Copies n bytes of a string into another string
3: Compares two strings, seeking the first different character
and returns the difference
4: Reverses an array of integers
5: Change lowercase chars to uppercase chars
6: Capitalize all words in astring in Camel case
7: Encode/encrypt a string using 1337(leet), using only one if, two loops,
no switch statement or ternary operator
8: Encode/encrypt a string using ROT13 encryption using only one if, two loops,
no switch statement or ternary operator
9: Print negative and positive numbers without using long int
102: Move in memory using a pointer to an int to access and change
the value of an int array.
So it is 'illegally' accessing the memory allocation of the array
from the outside (I know... the file is literally called 102-magic.c)
